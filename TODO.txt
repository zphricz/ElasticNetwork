- Switch from Euler's method to Runge Kutta (Err... How do I do that?)
- Overhaul information hiding because it makes no sense how it's implemented now
- Make the damp factor's value range much nicer to play with
- Fix memory leaks with Nodes that are never freed
- Fix bug where delete Nodes still have connections drawn to them
- Fix how input is handled
